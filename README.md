# Cryptocurrencies

## Objective:

The purpose of this data analysis is to generate a report using unsupervised machine learning that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

This data analysis includes four steps:
1. Preprocessing the Data for PCA
2. Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA
3. Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-means
4. Visualizing Cryptocurrencies Results

## Resources:
* Software: Python 3.9.15, Anaconda Navigator 2.3.2, Conda 23.1.0, Jupyter Notebook 6.5.2

## Results:
 All the analysis result can be found on this [link](https://github.com/abraham-22/Cryptocurrencies/blob/main/crypto_clustering.ipynb).
